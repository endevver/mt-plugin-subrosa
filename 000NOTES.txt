fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you
want to merge with, and 'branch.master.merge' in
your configuration file does not tell me, either. Please
specify which branch you want to use on the command line and
try again (e.g. 'git pull <repository> <refspec>').
See git-pull(1) for details.

If you often merge with the same branch, you may want to
use something like the following in your configuration file:

    [branch "master"]
    remote = <nickname>
    merge = <remote-ref>

    [remote "<nickname>"]
    url = <url>
    fetch = <refspec>

See git-config(1) for details.
fatal: Where do you want to fetch from today?

error: Your local changes to 'plugins/Send2PQ/config.yaml' would be overwritten by merge.  Aborting.
Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
