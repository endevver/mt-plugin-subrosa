    o the iMIS piece is coming together, thank god. That means I finally have profile data I am beginning to work with. So I wanted to share with you the key pieces of custom field data that the privacy component will hinge upon.

    1) Member Status

    This is an enumeration of strings with a number of valid values including: Active Member,Denied or Suspended,Complimentary,Marked for Deletion,Inactive Member,Not Applicable,Prospect Member,Expired Member,Salesforce Insert,Declined Membership,Unknown

    A value of "Active Member" is what allows them to view protected content.

    This value is accessed using this perl code: $author->meta('customfield_private_ccsa_member_status');

    2) Member Type

    Also an enumeration with values including: Charter School,Charter Support,Developer,Employee,Found. Funder,Government Agency,Individual Contact,ListServ,Member,Media,Other Non Member,Non_Member_Org,Public User,SELPA,Salesforce Co,Vendor,Web Sign-Up

    Any value allows them to see content, however a value of 'Vendor' may have some special cases.

    This value is accessed using this perl code: $author->meta('customfield_private_ccsa_member_type');
